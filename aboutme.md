A short autobiographical piece

I was born in Chengdu, China in the early 90's. Located in the southwestern region of the country, it is the capital of the greater Sichuan province, famous for its pandas and hotpot, and my father's hometown. My stay here was fairly brief, as shortly after turning one, I relocated to Beijing to live with my maternal grandparents. There, I would spend the first several years of childhood, under the auspice of my grandparents, while my parents were hard at work establishing themselves in America and preparing an optimal living environment for my eventual reunion with them in 1999. 

Technically, my first steps in America was in the Detroit Metro Airport. I still remember my grandmother hurrying me along as we were trying to catch our connecting flight to Newark International Airport.
