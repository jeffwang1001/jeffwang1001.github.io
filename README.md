**Hello and Welcome!**

I am currently a 4th year MD/PhD student at <a href="https://www.uthscsa.edu/academics/biomedical-sciences/programs/md-phd" target="_blank">UT Health San Antonio</a>, where I am advised by <a href="https://directory.uthscsa.edu/academics/profile/sungp" target="_blank">Patrick Sung</a> in the <a href="https://lsom.uthscsa.edu/biochemistry" target="_blank">Department of Biochemistry and Structural Biology</a>.

My primary research interests are in DNA repair and cancer biology. I employ biochemical methods to examine protein complexes involved in HR mediated DNA repair and their overall functional impact on cancer progression.

I was formerly a research associate in the <a href="http://www.kosurilab.org/" target="_blank">Kosuri Lab</a> at UCLA, where I worked on engineering cellular-based high throughout reporter assays for interrogating olfactory receptor activation, DMS of ADRB2, and splicing. I graduated in 2017 with a BS/MS in Biochemistry from UCLA, where I was advised by <a href="http://www.biochemistry.ucla.edu/Faculty/Quinlan/quinlanLab/" target="_blank">Margot Quinlan</a>.

Outside of lab, I enjoy board games, anything outdoors, and cycling.
