## Undergraduate Work

During my tenure in the Quinlan Lab at UCLA, I studied the protein-protein interaction between Drosophila Spire and Drosophila Rab GTPases within the context of polarity establishment during Drosophila oogenesis. This work culminated in a Master's Thesis as a part of the Departmental Scholars Program.

## Research Associate

During my two years of postbac research training, I worked as a research associate/lab manager in the Kosuri Lab at UCLA.
