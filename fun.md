## Quinlan Lab

Departmental party after Margot recieved tenure in July of 2016! It was well deserved and I am extremely grateful to have been a part of the lab during my time as an undergrad at UCLA. It was my first lab experience and I give immense credit to Dr. Quinlan for giving me the oppurtunity to learn, explore and realize my passion for research. In addition, Dr. Silkworth (pictured on the far right) was instrumental in my development and training during my time in the lab and I credit him for my research growth and independence towards the latter half of my time in the lab. Plus, it was only right in a protein biochemistry lab to start me on a protein purification my first day in the lab! Lastly, I want to thank the entire lab for providing not only a welcoming research environment for an undergrad just starting out, but also for all the fun and lasting memories during my time at UCLA.
